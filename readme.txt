1. We provided MATLAB codes to reproduce our main results in Nested Interaction Network Enhances Responsiveness in Collective Behavior,
including 1) biological analysis; 2) SIR-type simulation; 3) collective turns in pybullet; 4) robotic experiments;
2. We provided minimal dataset and data for any graphs and charts to reproduce any examples we showed in the main text, e.g., fish data and robotic trajectory, deposited in 'data' folder;
3. The folder 'utility' includes each necessary function used to reproduce results in this work;
4. We run our coedes with MATLAB R2021B, on MACOS with the core of M1 pro.
5. please make sure the installation of MATLAB visualization tool, provided in https://github.com/piermorel/gramm;
6. We thank open source MATLAB visualizeion codes provided by slander suibi.

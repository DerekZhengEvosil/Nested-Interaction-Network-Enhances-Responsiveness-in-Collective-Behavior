Instructions for running the codes in this folder.
In the following, we provided detailed running instructions and comments for key codes.

1. clear: Clears the workspace, removing all variables to start fresh.
2. clc: Clears the command window for a clean output display.
3. addpath("../data/") and addpath("../utility/"): These commands add additional directories to the MATLAB search path, ensuring the program can access required files from those locations.
4. load("*.mat"): This command loads the dataset stored in the high_maneuverability.mat file, which contains experimental data related to the high/low maneuverability example.
